TEST LOGIN LOCALLY BEFORE DEPLOYING
====================================

The deployed version (posteradmin.lapoelectioncart.com) doesn't have your latest code changes!

You need to either:
1. Test locally first
2. Deploy the changes to Vercel

OPTION 1: TEST LOCALLY (RECOMMENDED)
-------------------------------------

1. Open terminal in admin-panel folder

2. Create .env file:
   copy .env.example .env

3. Edit .env file:
   VITE_API_URL=https://postermaker-backend.onrender.com

4. Install dependencies (if not done):
   npm install

5. Start local server:
   npm run dev

6. Open browser:
   http://localhost:5174

7. Try to login:
   Username: aseeb
   Password: Dr.aseeb123

8. Check console (F12):
   - Should see "=== FORM SUBMITTED ==="
   - Should see alert popup
   - Should see API URL logs
   - Should see network request

OPTION 2: DEPLOY TO VERCEL
---------------------------

1. Commit changes:
   cd admin-panel
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix login function"
   git push

2. Vercel will auto-deploy (takes 2-3 minutes)

3. Wait for deployment to complete

4. Test on: https://posteradmin.lapoelectioncart.com

5. Check console for logs

CURRENT ISSUE
-------------
You're testing on the deployed site, but the deployed site has OLD CODE.

The changes we made are only in your local files, not deployed yet!

WHAT TO DO NOW
--------------

Choose one:

A) Test Locally:
   1. cd admin-panel
   2. npm run dev
   3. Open http://localhost:5174
   4. Try login
   5. Check console

B) Deploy First:
   1. Commit and push to GitHub
   2. Wait for Vercel deployment
   3. Test on live site

DEBUGGING STEPS
---------------

If testing locally and still stuck:

1. Check console immediately after clicking login
2. Should see: "=== FORM SUBMITTED ==="
3. Should see alert popup
4. Should see API URL in console
5. Should see network request in Network tab

If you DON'T see these:
- JavaScript error preventing function from running
- Check console for any red errors
- Check if React is loaded properly

If you DO see these but still stuck:
- Backend issue
- Check what the network request returns
- Check backend logs on Render

QUICK TEST
----------
To verify the function works, add this to console:

document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
  console.log('Form submit event fired!');
});

Then try to login. If you see "Form submit event fired!" but not "=== FORM SUBMITTED ===", 
there's an issue with the handleSubmit function.

MOST LIKELY CAUSE
-----------------
You're testing the deployed version which has old code!

Solution: Test locally OR deploy changes first!
